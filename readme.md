How to Use SeedGen for Wallet Recovery

To begin using SeedGen for wallet recovery or seed phrase generation, follow these steps:

    Download SeedGen and run the SeedGen.exe file.
    Press the '2' key to start searching for wallets by seed phrase.
    SeedGen will automatically generate new seed phrases and check the balances of the corresponding wallet addresses.
    The program will display all found wallets with non-zero balances in the console.
    Any recovered wallets with funds will also be recorded in the found_wallets.txt file located in the project directory.

Tip: To speed up the wallet recovery process, itâ€™s recommended to run 2-4 instances of SeedGen simultaneously. This will improve the chances of finding wallets with balances quickly. However, keep in mind that luck plays a significant role in the success of finding a wallet.
